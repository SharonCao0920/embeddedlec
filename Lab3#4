/*4. Find that entered year is leap year or not
[hint] In the Gregorian calendar three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap 
years:
- The year can be evenly divided by 4;
- If the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;
- The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
